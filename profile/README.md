## The platform is comprised of four key repositories:  

* [Edge AI Suites](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites) are curated collections of building blocks, industry-specific libraries, and sample applications designed to help you develop optimized AI solutions tailored to specific use cases. Currently, four suites are available: Retail, Manufacturing, Metro, and Media & Entertainment.
* [Edge AI Libraries](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries) provide edge-optimized, composable libraries, SDKs, and microservices to support the development of performant, production-grade multimodal edge AI applications, along with user-friendly workflows for optimization and deployment.
* [Edge Manageability Framework](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework) provides capabilities and building blocks for secure onboarding, provisioning, and management of edge devices and edge node software, along with orchestration of edge and AI applications and clusters at scale. 
* [Edge Microvisor Toolkit](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit) is an edge-optimized container host with a minimal footprint, designed to harness the latest Intel silicon capabilities for deploying advanced AI workloads at the edge.

Each repository includes contribution guidelines and templates for reporting issues.

Unless otherwise noted, the platform’s repositories are primarily released under the Apache 2.0 license.
