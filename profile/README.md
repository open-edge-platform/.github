# Welcome to the Open Edge Platform GitHub Organization! 

Intel’s [Open Edge Platform](https://github.com/open-edge-platform) [documentation website](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/) is a secure, optimized open platform for delivering scalable edge solutions. 

It offers a modular, composable software stack that brings together the open source ecosystem to help you build optimized edge and AI solutions and securely operationalize them with cloud-like capabilities.

## The platform is comprised of five key repositories:  

* [Edge AI Suites](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites) are curated collections of building blocks, industry-specific libraries,
  and sample applications designed to help you develop optimized AI solutions tailored to specific use cases. Currently, five suites are featured:
  [Metro](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/metro-ai-suite),
  [Manufacturing](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/manufacturing-ai-suite),
  [Retail](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/retail-ai-suite),
  [Robotics](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite), and
  [Education](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/education-ai-suite).
* [Edge AI Libraries](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries) provide edge-optimized, composable libraries, SDKs, and microservices
  to support the development of performant, production-grade multimodal edge AI applications, along with user-friendly workflows for optimization and
  deployment.
* [Edge Manageability Framework](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework) provides capabilities and building blocks for
  secure onboarding, provisioning, and management of edge devices and edge node software, along with orchestration of edge and AI applications and
  clusters at scale. 
* [Edge Microvisor Toolkit](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit) is an edge-optimized container host with a minimal footprint,
  designed to harness the latest Intel silicon capabilities for deploying advanced AI workloads at the edge.
* [Edge Workloads and Benchmarks](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-workloads-and-benchmarks) are performance-optimized pipelines that leverage the OpenVINO™ toolkit, the GStreamer multimedia framework,
  and the Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer) for validating media and edge AI analytics benchmarks.

Each repository includes contribution guidelines and templates for reporting issues.

Unless otherwise noted, the platform’s repositories are primarily released under the Apache 2.0 license.
